# Tutorials by David Lindes

This is (to be) a collection of tutorials, and/or supporting content for
them, developed by David Lindes.  Content so far was developed as part
of the work I've done as a Technical Mentor at
[Hackbright Academy](https://hackbrightacademy.com/).


## Current tutorials, and descriptions of what's here:

### hb-bigo - "Big-O in practice"

[This directory](./hb-bigo) contains supporting code from a tutorial
developed for engineering fellows at Hackbright.  The goal of this
tutorial is to show how one can gather and report on timing data of
code, and use that to analyze performance -- including (without
limitation) determining (or validating one's analysis of) the
"[big-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)" performance of
said code.

The code herein isn't entirely complete to capture what was in the
tutorial, but should be enough to provide examples of the most salient
bits.

(Note: The slides for the talk are not currently included in this
repository.  They were developed specifically for students at
Hackbright, and they're available by request to Hackbright alumnae.  I'm
open to requests from others, I just haven't yet decided whether and how
I want to release them to a broader audience.  It's not entirely
unlikely that I'll release them under a CC-BY-NC-SA license at some
point, so... feel free to ask.)

## More to come.

I'm currently developing some other content.  Some of it won't be in
a presentation format, but instead just code that folks could look at,
and/or that I would walk someone through.
