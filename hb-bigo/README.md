# Determining Big-O - performance measurement

The content of this folder is info for a class on doing performance
measurement, to determine Big-O of a set of algorithms, via timing of
actual performance, graphing thereof, and then fitting graphs to the
data points to predict, and then test, measurements of larger data for
the same algorithm.

# The description that went out:

During this session, he provides a review of effective ways for
approaching algorithms. Curious about how big-O works out in the real
world? Wanting to understand how different algorithms and approaches
behave? Wondering if it's more efficient to do a list comprehension
versus building up a list another way? David will talk about some of the
considerations for performance, and present ways to actually measure and
compare different solutions to a problem.
