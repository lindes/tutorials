# Determining Big-O - performance measurement

The content of this folder is info for a class on doing performance
measurement, to determine Big-O of a set of algorithms, via timing of
actual performance, graphing thereof, and then fitting graphs to the
data points to predict, and then test, measurements of larger data for
the same algorithm.
