CSV files are meant to be created by code above; PNG files with and
without guess lines are created via ../plot-csvs on *.csv, which
references the matching .guesses file, and generates the images.

I'm fairly sure there are missing pieces for regenerating all the data
and images that landed in the slide deck.  That said, this should give
the basic structure of how it's done, so folks can generate new graphs
as desired, at least, provided new data.
